= Personal notes

== C
* `x ? : y` is equivalent to `x ? x : y`
* https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Zero-Length.html[Zero length array] is often used to declare a pointer to variable length object, as a last member of a struct.
** e.g. listen_sock's syn_table member in `include/net/request_sock.h`

== TIPS
* To check if a function can be attached by kprobe
** `$ sudo grep $func_name /proc/kallsyms`
